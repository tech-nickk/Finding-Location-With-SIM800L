# SIM800L GSM Location Finder

This project demonstrates how to find an approximate location using a SIM800L GSM/GPRS module and online GSM tower databases. The SIM800L module connects to the GSM network and provides information about the cell tower it's connected to, including the Cell ID (CId) and Location Area Code (LAC). This information can then be used to estimate the approximate location of the device by querying online GSM tower databases.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- SIM800L GSM/GPRS module
- Antenna for the SIM800L module
- SIM card with a data plan and network coverage
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for Arduino programming
- Power source for the SIM800L module (e.g., Li-Po battery or external power supply)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the hardware and software for the SIM800L GSM Location Finder:

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the SIM800L module to your Arduino board using jumper wires. Make sure to connect the RX and TX pins appropriately.
   - Insert the SIM card into the SIM800L module.
   - Connect the antenna to the SIM800L module.
   - Provide power to the SIM800L module according to its voltage requirements.

2. **Arduino IDE:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE if you haven't already.

3. **Library Installation:**
   - Install the necessary libraries for the SIM800L module if required.

4. **Upload Code:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.
  


```cpp
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial sim800l(7, 8); // RX, TX pins for communication with SIM800L

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);   // Serial monitor
  sim800l.begin(9600);  // SIM800L module
  delay(1000);
}

void loop() {
  // Send the AT+CNETSCAN=1 command
  sim800l.println("AT+CNETSCAN=1");
  delay(1000);

  // Send the AT+CNETSCAN command
  sim800l.println("AT+CNETSCAN");
  delay(10000); // Wait for response, adjust as needed

  // Read and print response from SIM800L
  while (sim800l.available()) {
    char c = sim800l.read();
    Serial.write(c);
  }

  delay(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds before repeating
}
```

**Explanation**:

This code is an Arduino sketch that communicates with the SIM800L GSM/GPRS module using the SoftwareSerial library. It sends AT commands to the module to initiate a network scan and retrieve information about nearby cell towers. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- It includes the `SoftwareSerial` library, which is used to create a software serial connection between the Arduino and the SIM800L module.

- In the `setup()` function:
  - It initializes both the Serial monitor and the `sim800l` software serial connection at a baud rate of 9600.
  - It adds a delay of 1 second for initialization.

- In the `loop()` function (the main program loop):
  - It sends the AT+CNETSCAN=1 command to the SIM800L module, which starts a network scan.
  - It adds a delay of 1 second to allow time for the module to process the command.
  - It sends the AT+CNETSCAN command to retrieve information about nearby cell towers.
  - It adds a delay of 10 seconds to allow the module to respond with tower information (adjust this delay as needed).
  - It enters a loop to read and print the response from the SIM800L module character by character.
  - It adds a delay of 5 seconds before repeating the process.

The purpose of this code is to provide a basic example of how to use the SIM800L module to perform a network scan and obtain information about nearby cell towers. This information can be used to estimate the approximate location of the device by querying online GSM tower databases, as mentioned in your project's documentation.

## Configuration

Before running the code, you may need to configure the following settings:

- APN (Access Point Name): Set the correct APN for your mobile carrier. This is essential for establishing a GPRS connection.

## Usage

1. **Power On:**
   - Power on your Arduino board and the SIM800L module.

2. **Serial Monitor:**
   - Open the Arduino Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) to view the output.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The code will send AT commands to the SIM800L module to initialize it, establish a GPRS connection, and request GSM location information.

4. **Location Estimation:**
   - The code will parse the response from the module to extract MCC, MNC, Cell ID (CId) and Location Area Code (LAC) information.

5. **Online GSM Tower Databases:**
   - Visit online GSM tower databases such as [OpenCellID](https://opencellid.org/) or [Cell2GPS](http://www.cell2gps.com/).
   - Enter the MCC, MNC, CId and LAC values you get on the serial monitor to estimate the approximate location of the SIM800L module.
   - Ensure that you take into account the necessity to transform the Cell ID and LAC from their hexadecimal representation into a decimal format.
